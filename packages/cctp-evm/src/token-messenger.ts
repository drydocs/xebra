/**
 * CCTP V2 `TokenMessengerV2.depositForBurnWithHook`, the one call that starts a transfer from an
 * EVM chain.
 *
 * On these routes the browser calls Circle directly, with no Xebra contract in between. The
 * Soroban wrapper fixes three things on the Stellar route and nothing does that here, so this
 * encoder fixes them instead and takes no argument for any of them:
 *
 *   - **the hook** is `FORWARD_HOOK`, which asks Circle's Forwarding Service to deliver the mint,
 *     or for a Solana recipient with no USDC account yet the 65-byte form that also opens one.
 *     Both are built here from a validated owner; a caller cannot pass hook bytes of its own;
 *   - **`destinationCaller`** is zero, so anyone may submit the mint. Circle's forwarder requires
 *     it, and it is what keeps a failed delivery claimable by its owner at `/claim`;
 *   - **`minFinalityThreshold`** is one of Circle's two speeds, never a number in between.
 *
 * The signature is not in Circle's published ABI package we depend on; its selector, `0x779b432d`,
 * is checked against the live implementation bytecode on every chain by
 * `scripts/check-evm-cctp.sh`.
