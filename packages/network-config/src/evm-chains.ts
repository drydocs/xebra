/**
 * The EVM chains USDC moves between over CCTP without a Xebra contract in the path, and the one
 * non-EVM chain, Solana, that Arc sends to the same way.
 *
 * On these routes the browser calls Circle's `TokenMessengerV2` directly, so there is no wrapper
 * to bound a fee, fix the hook or refuse a domain. Everything a transfer rests on is in this
 * table instead, which is why it is pinned by a test and re-read from the chains by
 * `scripts/check-evm-cctp.sh`.
 *
 * # Which chains
 *
 * Every chain Circle's Forwarding Service delivers to from Arc, as Iris answered on 2026-10-14:
 * `GET /v2/burn/USDC/fees/26/{d}?forward=true` returns a forwarding fee for domains 0, 1, 2, 3, 5,
 * 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22 and 28, and refuses every other domain. Each of
 * the EVM ones also forwards *into* Arc, so they are offered both ways. Solana is a destination
 * only: sending from Solana needs a Solana signer, which these routes do not have.
 *
 * # Provenance
 *
 * Read from the live chains with `cast`, not from documentation (2026-10-09 and 2026-10-14):
 *
 * - Arc's `TokenMessengerV2.remoteTokenMessengers(d)` names each chain's messenger. On seventeen
 *   of the eighteen it is the same address as Arc's, and so are the transmitter and minter. That
 *   is convenient and also the hazard: a call made on the wrong chain reaches a real Circle
 *   contract and returns a plausible answer.
 * - EDGE (domain 28) is the exception: its own deployment, at its own three addresses. Nothing
 *   here may assume one address set.
 * - Domain ids are each chain's `MessageTransmitterV2.localDomain()`.
 * - Each chain's `TokenMinterV2.getLocalToken(26, <Arc USDC>)` returns its USDC, and Arc's maps
 *   it back. Every one is a 6-decimal token whose symbol is `USDC`.
 *
 * `rpcUrl` is a public endpoint used for two things only: handing a wallet a chain it has never
 * seen (`wallet_addEthereumChain`) and the read-only check script. No transfer is read or sent
 * through it; the wallet's own node does that.
