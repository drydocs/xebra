/**
 * The EVM chains USDC moves between over CCTP without a Xebra contract in the path, and the one
 * non-EVM chain, Solana, that Arc sends to the same way.
 *
 * On these routes the browser calls Circle's `TokenMessengerV2` directly, so there is no wrapper
 * to bound a fee, fix the hook or refuse a domain. Everything a transfer rests on is in this
 * table instead, which is why it is pinned by a test and re-read from the chains by
 * `scripts/check-evm-cctp.sh`.
 *
 * # Which chains
 *
 * Circle's Forwarding Service delivers from Arc to domains 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
 * 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22 and 28, as Iris answered on 2026-10-14
 * (`GET /v2/burn/USDC/fees/26/{d}?forward=true`), and refuses every other domain. All of those are
 * here except four, left out on purpose:
 *
 * - Ethereum (0): delivery there costs about 1.4 USDC, so the smallest sensible transfer is about
 *   fifteen dollars.
 * - Linea (11): a Standard transfer from Linea takes 6 to 32 hours.
 * - Plume (22) and EDGE (28): Circle publishes no Standard timing for either, and EDGE runs its own
 *   deployment of Circle's contracts with an explorer we could not reach.
 *
 * Each EVM chain here also forwards *into* Arc, so they are offered both ways. Solana is a
 * destination only: sending from Solana needs a Solana signer, which these routes do not have.
 *
 * # Provenance
 *
 * Read from the live chains with `cast`, not from documentation (2026-10-09 and 2026-10-14):
 *
 * - Arc's `TokenMessengerV2.remoteTokenMessengers(d)` names each chain's messenger. On every chain
 *   here it is the same address as Arc's, and so are the transmitter and minter. That is
 *   convenient and also the hazard: a call made on the wrong chain reaches a real Circle contract
 *   and returns a plausible answer. Not every Circle chain shares them (EDGE does not), so each
 *   row still names its own three.
 * - Domain ids are each chain's `MessageTransmitterV2.localDomain()`.
 * - Each chain's `TokenMinterV2.getLocalToken(26, <Arc USDC>)` returns its USDC, and Arc's maps
 *   it back. Every one is a 6-decimal token whose symbol is `USDC`.
 *
 * `rpcUrl` is a public endpoint used for two things only: handing a wallet a chain it has never
 * seen (`wallet_addEthereumChain`) and the read-only check script. No transfer is read or sent
 * through it; the wallet's own node does that.
