/**
 * Client for `contracts/stellar-cctp-wrapper-v2` — Stellar to Solana and Arc, delivered by Circle's
 * Forwarding Service.
 *
 * # There is no direct mode
 *
 * An earlier version could burn straight through Circle's TokenMessengerMinter when the wrapper was
 * not deployed. That produced a burn with nobody to mint it: the relay that used to do so is gone,
 * and a burn without the forwarding hook is only ever claimed by its owner. Every transfer now goes
 * through the wrapper, which puts the hook on the burn.
 *
 * # The fee breakdown is read from the contract, never recomputed here
 *
 * `quoteBridge` simulates the wrapper's own `quote()` view rather than reimplementing
 * `fee = max(amount * fee_bps / 10_000, min_fee)` in TypeScript. Two reasons:
 *
 * 1. The parameters are on-chain and can change under a 48h timelock. A hardcoded copy in the
 *    frontend would silently disagree with reality after any `commit_params`.
 * 2. The rounding is load-bearing. `net` is floored to a 10-stroop boundary because Stellar
 *    USDC has 7 decimals and CCTP's canonical representation has 6; a JS reimplementation
 *    that got that wrong would quote a number the contract never burns.
 *
 * # `max_fee` is the delivery fee, and comes from Circle's quote
 *
 * With forwarding, `max_fee` is what Circle charges, in full, to mint on the destination (gas plus
 * its service fee). It is taken from Circle's live forward-fee quote (`lib/forward-fee.ts`) and
 * bounded on chain by a per-domain cap and a tenth of the burn, so a buggy front end cannot hand
 * away a user's principal.

 * Inclusion-fee bid, in stroops (0.1 XLM).
 *
 * This is a **bid ceiling, not a charge**. Stellar charges the market clearing rate up to
 * your bid, so bidding high costs nothing in the normal case and buys reliable inclusion when
 * the network is busy.
 *
 * `BASE_FEE` (100) is the network *minimum*, and using it was the bug behind the first real
 * mainnet attempt: the approve was accepted by the client, never included in any ledger, and
 * came back NOT_FOUND on both Horizon and Soroban RPC. Live mainnet stats at the time:
 *
 *     ledger_capacity_usage  0.78          (surge pricing active)
 *     max_fee bids  p50      144,395       (we were bidding 100)
 *     fee_charged   p50      100           (what you actually pay)
 *
 * So the median bid was ~1,400x ours while the median *charge* was the floor. 0.1 XLM sits
 * above the observed p90 of fees actually charged (9,486) with a wide margin, and caps the
 * worst case at roughly three cents.
 *
 * `prepareTransaction` adds Soroban's deterministic resource fee on top; this bids only for

 * **Keys.** A JS object becomes an ScMap, and its string keys default to `scvString`. Soroban
 * `#[contracttype]` structs are maps keyed by `scvSymbol`. A string-keyed map has the right field
 * names and the wrong key type, so the contract cannot unpack it.
 *
 * **Integers.** The SDK picks "the smallest XDR integer type that will fit the value". So
 * `amount` of 100000000 goes out as a small int rather than the `i128` the contract declares, and
 * `destination_domain` of 5 does not become `u32` because 5 fits in something narrower. The
 * encoding then depends on the *value*, which means a request can encode correctly at one amount
 * and incorrectly at another.
 *
 * Both faults surface identically and unhelpfully: `Error(Value, UnexpectedType)` out of
 * `map_unpack_to_linear_memory`, naming no field. This cost a live mainnet attempt to find.
 *
 * Each entry below is `[keyType, valueType]`; `null` means the SDK's default, used only for
 * `user`, where an `Address` instance is already unambiguous.
