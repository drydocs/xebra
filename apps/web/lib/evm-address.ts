/**
 * Validation for a recipient on an EVM chain, whichever one the dollars land on.
 *
 * The same stakes as `solana-address.ts`: the mint goes to whatever this produces, a CCTP burn is
 * irreversible, and the Stellar wrapper can only check the *shape* (`check_mint_recipient` accepts
 * any non-zero, left-padded 20-byte value). On the routes that call Circle directly there is no
 * contract checking even that. Neither can tell a wallet from a mistake; that is this file's job.
 *
 * # What it refuses beyond "is it hex"
 *
 *   - **A bad checksum.** A mixed-case address carries an EIP-55 checksum; one that fails it has a
 *     typo in it, and would otherwise be a perfectly valid address that nobody controls. An
 *     all-lowercase or all-uppercase address has no checksum to fail and is accepted, because
 *     refusing what most explorers and wallets copy would be its own failure.
 *   - **Addresses that can never hold a balance for a person:** the zero address, the low
 *     "precompile" range and burn addresses like `0x…dEaD`, and the contracts USDC itself would
 *     be minted *into* on that chain — the USDC token, and Circle's messenger, transmitter and
 *     minter. A mint to any of these is unrecoverable, and each is a plausible paste from an
 *     explorer page.
 *
 * It does not, and cannot, check that the recipient is a wallet rather than a contract that
 * refuses tokens, or that USDC's blocklist does not hold it. Both make the mint revert; the burn
 * is already done by then, which is what `/claim` exists for.
