 * Choosing the `maxFee` an EVM transfer signs, and refusing the ones it should not.
 *
 * On the Stellar route the wrapper contract bounds this number: a per-destination cap, and a tenth
 * of the burn. On the routes that call Circle directly nothing on chain does, and Circle keeps the
 * whole `maxFee` whatever delivery really cost (measured on Stellar; assumed here until a transfer
 * shows otherwise). So the same two bounds are applied in this file, before anyone is asked to
 * sign, and they are the only place they exist.
 *
 * The fee has two parts:
 *
 *   - **delivery**: Circle's `high` forwarding quote at 1.0x, the rule that has held on mainnet
 *     (`lib/forward-fee.ts`). Headroom above it is pure cost, because none of it comes back.
 *   - **speed**: Circle's Fast Transfer fee, a fraction of the amount, zero for Standard. Rounded
 *     up to a whole unit so the fee signed is never a unit short of the fee owed.
 *
 * All amounts are 6-decimal USDC units, the unit Circle quotes in.
