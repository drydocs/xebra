/**
 * Base58 decoding and validation for Solana addresses.
 *
 * This is the single most safety-critical value in the bridge UI. `mint_recipient` is where
 * the USDC is minted on the destination chain, and a CCTP burn is **irreversible** — there is
 * no admin unwind, no refund path, and no one to appeal to. A malformed or mistyped address
 * destroys the transfer.
 *
 * The contract catches chain-family confusion: `check_mint_recipient` rejects an EVM-shaped
 * (12-byte zero-prefixed) recipient on a Solana-destination transfer. It cannot catch a
 * well-formed Solana address the user does not control — that is a frontend responsibility,
 * which is why validation lives here and is exercised by tests.
 *
 * Written by hand rather than pulling in `bs58`: the decode is ~30 lines, the project does not
 * already depend on it, and a dependency in the funds path is worth avoiding when the
 * alternative is this small and directly testable.
