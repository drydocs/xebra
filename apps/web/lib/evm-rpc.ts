/**
 * The handful of JSON-RPC calls an EVM transfer or claim needs, made through the user's own wallet.
 *
 * No connector framework and no client object, for the reason `lib/wallets/evm.ts` gives. What this
 * adds over calling `provider.request` in place is the part that is easy to get subtly wrong:
 *
 *   - **Which chain the wallet is really on.** Circle's contracts sit at the same addresses on
 *     every chain this app touches, so a call made on the wrong one does not fail. It reaches a
 *     real contract and returns a plausible answer about a different chain. `ensureChain` therefore
 *     re-reads the chain id after asking for a switch and refuses on a mismatch, rather than
 *     trusting that a switch which did not throw also happened.
 *   - **A refusal is not a failure.** A wallet rejects with a plain object and a numeric code;
 *     the ones a person causes or can fix are turned into a sentence here.
 *   - **A dropped read is not an answer.** The receipt poll goes through whatever node the wallet
 *     uses, and one failed request must not be reported as a transaction that never landed.
