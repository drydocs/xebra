/**
 * Choosing the `max_fee` a transfer signs, from Circle's forward-fee quote.
 *
 * With Circle's Forwarding Service the `max_fee` on the burn *is* the delivery fee: Circle charges the
 * whole of it, gas and service together, and keeps any excess as a priority fee with no refund. So it
 * is neither a ceiling to pad nor a number to guess. The rule used here is the one that held on
 * mainnet: Circle's `high` tier at 1.0x. `low` is stable but has not been proven to be accepted;
 * `med` and `high` drift a few percent over minutes, and 1.0x of `high` still landed twice when the
 * quote had moved 7 to 9 percent between the check and the send.
 *
 * The contract bounds the result anyway (a per-domain cap, and a tenth of the burn), so a wrong
 * choice here can fail a transfer before signing but cannot overcharge one. This module exists so
 * that failure reads as a sentence, and so a route the contract has switched off is refused before
 * anyone is asked to sign.
 *
 * Amounts: Circle quotes in the 6-decimal canonical unit, Stellar USDC has 7. One canonical unit is
 * ten stroops.
