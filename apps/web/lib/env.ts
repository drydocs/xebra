/**
 * The frontend's single source of network truth.
 *
 * # Why every variable is referenced literally
 *
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are **inlined by webpack at compile time**, and that substitution is
 * purely textual: it only fires for a literal member expression like
 * `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK`. A dynamic lookup — `process.env[name]` — cannot be
 * statically analyzed, so in the **client** bundle it resolves against an empty `process.env`
 * shim and yields `undefined` for everything.
 *
 * That is not theoretical: the first version of this file used a `required(name)` helper
 * doing exactly that, and it threw "NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK is not set" in the browser while the
 * variable was correctly set in the server process the whole time.
 *
 * **Never** add a variable here by indexing `process.env`. Add a literal line to RAW.
 * `scripts/check-env-files.sh` fails on any dynamic access in client-bundled code.
 *
 * # Why this file does no cross-validation
 *
 * Validation lives in `scripts/check-build-network.mjs`, which runs in plain Node before the
 * bundler. Importing `@xebra/network-config` here instead dragged its entire PRESETS table
 * into the client bundle — every network's contract addresses, RPC URLs and passphrases
 * shipped in every build. All public values, so not a secret leak, but it meant a bundle's
 * target network could not be determined by inspecting it, since mainnet and testnet
 * constants were both present regardless of which one it was built for.
 *
 * Re-validating in the browser would also prove nothing: by then the values are already
 * baked in. Coherence is a build-time property, checked at build time, once.
 *
 * # Why there are no fallbacks
 *
 * Because `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is baked in at build time, a production deployment cannot correct a
 * frontend built against the wrong network. The previous defaults made that dangerous:
 *
 *   lib/wagmi.ts:  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ARC_CHAIN_ID ?? "9001"          // anvil
 *   app/page.tsx:  ...PASSPHRASE ?? "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"    // TESTNET
 *
 * A single missing build arg produced a *working* testnet frontend rather than a failed
 * build. Every fallback is gone: a missing variable is a hard failure.
