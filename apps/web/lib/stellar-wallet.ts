 * Freighter and the LOBSTR browser extension. Stellar Wallets Kit supports more, but

 * extension has no `signAuthEntry`, which is fine: open-intent.ts signs the whole transaction.
 *
 * # The network is derived, never defaulted
 *
 * This function used to default to `WalletNetwork.TESTNET`. On a mainnet build that meant the
 * wallet was asked to sign against the wrong network while every other part of the app was
 * correctly configured for mainnet — the exact wrong-network class of bug the whole config
 * layer exists to prevent, hiding in a default argument.
 *
 * The passphrase is the authoritative network identifier, so it is the thing mapped here
 * rather than a separate flag that could drift from it.

 * sleep and needs longer than that to wake. So the screen said "not detected" for a wallet that was
 * installed and would connect fine, and only said "detected" for one opened a moment ago. The
