/**
 * Starting a USDC transfer from an EVM chain, by calling Circle's contracts directly or through
 * Xebra's fee wrapper where the chain has one (`via`).
 *
 * Direct, the wallet approves Circle's `TokenMessengerV2` for the amount and calls
 * `depositForBurnWithHook` on it. Through the wrapper it approves the wrapper and calls its
 * `bridge`, which keeps Xebra's fee and makes the same burn itself. Either way Circle's Forwarding
 * Service mints on the destination.
 * There is no relay, so everything that can be checked is checked *before* the burn, which is the
 * one step that cannot be undone:
 *
 *   - the wallet is on the source chain, confirmed and not assumed (`ensureChain`);
 *   - the sender holds the amount;
 *   - the allowance really is the amount after approving (a wallet lets its user lower it);
 *   - the fee has not risen while an approval was confirming;
 *   - the burn succeeds when simulated as the sender.
 *
 * Two prompts, not one: an approval and the burn. A second transfer of the same or a smaller
 * amount after a failed first needs only the burn.
