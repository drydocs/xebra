/**
 * Circle's attested `(message, attestation)` pair for a burn.
 *
 * This is what makes a transfer claimable by anyone. Circle attests a burn and publishes the
 * signed pair; whoever holds it can submit `receiveMessage` on the destination chain and
 * complete the mint. Circle's Forwarding Service normally does that for you; when a forward does
 * not land, this route is what lets the owner do it themselves at `/claim`.
 *
 * # Why it is proxied rather than called from the browser
 *
 * Only so the Iris base URL stays a single server-side value. Iris itself permits browser
 * origins, unlike Solana's RPC. Making it a `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` would mean a build-time constant
 * baked into the bundle and one more variable that has to be right before the build — and
 * pointing at Circle's sandbox by mistake leaves every burn "pending" forever rather than failing
 * loudly.
 *
 * Nothing here is secret. The response is public data about a public transaction.
