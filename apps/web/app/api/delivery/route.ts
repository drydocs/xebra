/**
 * How a burn is getting on, straight from Circle. Polled by the receipt so the pending state
 * resolves instead of spinning.
 *
 * There is no relay to ask. Circle's Forwarding Service mints on the destination, and Iris reports
 * how that went (`forwardState`, `forwardTxHash`), so this is one budgeted lookup by transaction
 * hash, cached for a few seconds because every receipt for the same burn asks the same question.
 *
 * `unknown` means we could not ask — Circle unreachable, or our own rate budget holding us back. It
 * is deliberately not `waiting`: an unanswerable question is not progress, and the page must not
 * imply the transfer is fine or failed on the strength of it.
 *
 * A burn made on an EVM chain names it with `&src=<CCTP domain>`; with no `src` the burn is a
 * Stellar one, as every link sent before EVM sources existed assumes.
 *
 * Read-only and public: it answers only about a burn hash the caller already holds.
