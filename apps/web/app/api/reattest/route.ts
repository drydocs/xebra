/**
 * Asks Circle to attest a message again.
 *
 * Only a Fast burn needs this. Circle signs a Fast burn before its source chain has finalised, and
 * bounds how long that early signature stays good: the message carries an `expirationBlock` on the
 * destination, about a day out. Circle's Forwarding Service normally mints long before then. If it
 * did not, and nobody claimed in time, the mint reverts as expired. The money is not lost; Circle
 * issues a fresh attestation for the same nonce on request, and this is that request. `/claim`
 * offers it when it sees an expired message.
 *
 * Public and unauthenticated, like the attestation it refreshes: the nonce is public, and all this
 * can do is make Circle re-sign a message that already exists. It spends our Iris budget, so an
 * accepted request for a nonce is not repeated for a minute however many times the button is
 * pressed. A refusal is not remembered, so trying again is always a real attempt.
