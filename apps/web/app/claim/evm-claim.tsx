/**
 * The EVM half of `/claim`: complete an attested transfer from your own wallet, on whichever EVM
 * chain it was sent to.
 *
 * Deliberately parallel to the Solana flow on the same page rather than folded into it. The two
 * share a promise — the attestation is public, anyone may submit the mint — but nothing else: no
 * token account to create, no owner to be told, no rent. An EVM claim is connect, switch network,
 * sign once.
 *
 * One thing it has that the Solana flow does not: a Fast transfer's attestation runs out after
 * about a day. That is found by asking the chain whether the mint would succeed, and fixed by
 * asking Circle to sign again. The money was never at risk; the signature was only stale.
