/**
 * Moving USDC between Arc and another EVM chain, or from Arc to Solana, by calling Circle's
 * contracts directly.
 *
 * The sibling of `StellarBridgeForm`, and deliberately a sibling and not a branch inside it. That
 * form talks to a Soroban contract that bounds the fee and fixes the hook. This one calls Circle
 * directly unless the source chain has Xebra's own wrapper pinned and switched on
 * (`NEXT_PUBLIC_ARC_USE_WRAPPER`); either way every bound is applied here before signing
 * (`lib/evm-forward-fee.ts`, `lib/evm-bridge.ts`), and through the wrapper the contract applies
 * them again. The two forms never share a code path that money runs through.
 *
 * # What is different for the person
 *
 *   - **The wallet has to be on the source chain.** Circle's contracts have one address on every
 *     chain, so a read made on the wrong chain answers plausibly and wrongly. Nothing is read or
 *     sent until the wallet says it is on the chain the transfer starts from; until then the
 *     button is "Switch wallet to …".
 *   - **Two prompts.** An approval for the amount, then the transfer.
 *   - **The fee comes out of the amount.** The wallet is debited what was typed and the recipient
 *     is minted the rest. There is no fee of ours on this route.
 *   - **A speed, where there is one to choose.** See `SpeedPicker`.
 */

/**
 * How long Circle is given to deliver before an attested transfer is called claimable.

 * yet", and sending someone to pay gas for a mint Circle is about to do would be the wrong advice.
