/**
 * One job: move USDC from Stellar to Solana or an EVM chain over Circle's CCTP, through Xebra's
 * wrapper.
 * The bridge screen (`app/page.tsx`) shows this form when the source is Stellar; a transfer that
 * starts on an EVM chain is `evm-bridge-form.tsx`.
 *
 * # What is deliberately not asked
 *
 * There is no destination-asset field. CCTP is burn-and-mint of the *same* asset, so the
 * destination is native USDC by definition — asking which token would be asking which dollar.
 * It previously was a free-text SPL mint box, which was worse than redundant: the value
 * silently selected the routing rail, so a typo quietly became a different product, and the
 * placeholder was mainnet USDC even on testnet.
 *
 * The amount and the destination address are the only two things only the user can know.
 *
 * # Which chains are offered is read from the contract
 *
 * The wrapper sends only to the CCTP domains it has committed, and adding one takes a 48-hour
 * timelock. So the picker shows an EVM chain only when the build names it *and* the contract has
 * committed it (`stellarDestinations`), read once when the form opens and again every minute. A
 * chain appears by itself the moment its commit lands, and one the contract does not have is never
 * offered, because a transfer to it would be refused at signing.
 *
 * # Fee figures come from the contract
 *
 * The breakdown is read by simulating the wrapper's own `quote()`. Recomputing the fee in
 * TypeScript would drift the moment a `commit_params` lands, and the 10-stroop flooring
 * (7-decimal Stellar USDC vs CCTP's 6-decimal canonical form) is easy to get subtly wrong.
 *
 * # Where the design lives
 *
 * Nothing here styles itself from scratch. The plate, the fields, the rules and the buttons
 * are `components/ui/*`, so the screen that sends money cannot drift away from the one
 * that reports on it (`app/intent/[hash]`). See `tailwind.config.ts` for the tokens.
