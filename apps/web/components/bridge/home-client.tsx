/**
 * The bridge screen: the hero, the one plate that moves money, and what stands behind it.
 *
 * The plate's contents are a form per kind of source chain (`components/bridge/*-bridge-form`).
 * This file is the frame around them, which is the part that does not change with the route.
 * `app/page.tsx` renders it and passes the server-rendered sections below the plate as children.
 *
 * A link can preselect the route (`/?from=stellar&to=base`, as the route pages use). It is read
 * from `window.location` after mounting rather than through `useSearchParams`, which would turn the
 * whole page into client-only rendering and leave crawlers an empty shell.
